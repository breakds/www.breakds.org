CL-USER> (info :break)

- A software engineer forged in the crucible of code.
- A programmer since the early cycles of youth.
- A solver of problems, a seeker of logic.
- A devoted follower of the Deus Mechanicus.

In the sacred halls of academia, I pursued the holy disciplines of Mathematics, Control Theory, Economics, and Computer Vision. All in service to the grand quest of constructing sentient machines.

In recent cycles, my energies have been dedicated to crafting and perfecting the automations of the Omnissiahâ€”bringing efficiency and order to the realms of automotive, robotics, finance, and quantitative trading.
