CL-USER> (info :break)

My name is Break Yang.

I am a software engineer by trade, working on automating things (e.g. cars). 
I spent my school years studying Math, Control, Economics and Computer Vision.

Fun fact: I have been practicing programming since 6 when my father brings home a laptop. 

Currently, my main focus is in autonomous driving robots.
More specifically, building practical solutions 
for various driving :decision and :planning 
under :uncertain and :interactive scenarios.
