CL-USER> (info :break)

My name is Break Yang.

I am a software engineer by trade, working on automating things (e.g. cars). 

I spent my school years studying Math, Control, Economics and Computer Vision, in pursuite 
of a childhood dream of building robots.

Fun fact: I have been practicing programming since 6 when my father brings home a laptop. 

More specifically, I am currenctly working on building practical solutions 
for various :decision and :planning under :uncertain and :interactive scenarios.
